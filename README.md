This repo contains the build process for the Standard Vocabularies. Currently, it's work in progress. DO NOT clone and try to reproduce it, it won't work. :)

If you need the OMOP Standard Vocabularies, please send a note to reich@ohdsi.org. We are in the process of creating a download center. As soon as it is up and running we will notify you.
